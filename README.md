# Wine Quality Analysis

The consumption of wine around the world has been steadily on the rise through out the last decade. The growths come from not just major wine producing countries but also minor countries. This means that international trading of wine has been on the uptick to keep up with the overall demands.

Traditionally, wines are usually classified instead of rated for their quality. Wines produced in different continents have different systems of classifying their products. Europe countries kept the traditional of appellation classification. Newer producing countries such as the US and Australia are more favorable to class by grape variety. However, classification is not always a strong indicator of quality. The emergence of wine critic and review publications revolutionized how wines are marketed, by given sensory assessment scores.
  
The potential clients are wholesalers and winemakers who need to market their wines in multiple markets. Although sensory assessment is the most direct way to rate the quality of wine, it has limitation on the amount of wines each individual assessor can assess due to sensory fatigue and difficulty to calibrate sensory assessment among the group. Therefore, building a prediction model based on sensory assessment database is a great way to broadly implement sensory preference ratings beyond human limitation. 

My deliverables would be presented on my GitHub profile. It would mainly consists of three objects, a write up of the project, the data and codes, and a presentation deck. The paper would contain an abstract, introduction, description of the data, the results from the approaches to tackle the data, visualization of the data, and the analysis on the prediction model. The presentation deck would contain brief overview of the project and visuals on the problem solving and prediction model.
